In this section, you'll see that you can actually build a smaller but deeper neural network with exponentially less hidden units which performs even better than a network with more hidden units. The reason for this is that learning happens in each layer, and adding more layers (even with fewer limits) can lead to very powerful predictions! You'll learn about matrix notation for these deep networks and how to build a network like that from scratch.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Summary\n", "\n", "In this section, you'll extend your deep learning knowledge by learning about deeper neural networks.
